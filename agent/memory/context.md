SAIAS Context

Purpose: Persistent, human-authored guidance for SAIAS to reference during chats. Keep concise and secret‑free. Update as goals and conventions evolve.

Project Goals
- Build a local, offline‑first AI assistant that can refactor its own code and grow capabilities safely with human approval.

Conventions

- No new third‑party deps unless approved.

Environment
- OS: Windows
- Local models via Ollama (configure in agent/memory/config.json)

Current Focus
- Improve patch workflow and capability registry.

User Preferences
- Be concise and actionable by default.
